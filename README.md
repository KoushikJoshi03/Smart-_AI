Aim: Develop an AI-powered system to improve waste management by accurately identifying and sorting different types of waste material.
Key Features
Automated Sorting Process:

Utilized InceptioNetV3 Machine learning model for image classification to sort different categories of waste (plastic, metal, glass, paper, and cardboard).
Once the waste material is identified by the model, it is automatically sorted into the appropriate category or bin, where for instance, blue dustbin would be used for recyclable material such as paper.
Real-Time Video Processing:

In addition to image classification, our AI system is capable of performing real-time video processing, enabling seamless integration into existing waste management workflows.
By leveraging the computational power of hardware and optimized algorithms, our model can process videos in real-time, detecting and classifying waste materials as they appear.
Waste Disposal Guidance:

When a user submits an image or video, our system not only predicts the waste category but also offers specific guidance on the appropriate disposal method and the corresponding bin or container for that particular type of waste.
This feature provides users with the knowledge necessary to contribute to effective waste segregation and recycling efforts, promoting environmental responsibility and sustainable practices.

Challenges
Ambiguous Object Identification: Addressing instances where the system misidentifies certain materials, such as confusing plastic with glass.
Image Capturing through Camera Issues: Overcoming challenges in capturing objects through the userâ€™s camera and classifying the waste category.
Computational Expense in Training: Dealing with the computational intensity and time-consuming nature of the training process.
